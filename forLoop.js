1. For loop
	Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, 
	each time with a different value.

2. Syntax for Loops
	for (Statement 1; Statement 2; statement 3){
		//code block to be executed
	}	
	Statement 1 is executed (One time) before the execution of the code block.
	Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
	Statement 3 is executed (Every Time) after the code block has been executed.
